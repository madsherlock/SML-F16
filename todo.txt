- Make function for visualizing ONE digit in a matrix. 

- Make modified loadSinglePersonsData, which only reloads data,
if a file named data-<group no>-<member>-<DPI>-<kernel size>.R does not already exist.
Eg. data-2-1-300-5.R
The function must save data into the properly named .R files when loading the first time.
Put the data files in SML-F16/data.  ("../data/").
