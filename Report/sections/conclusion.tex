\chapter{Conclusion}
It could be seen from the data processing
that the smoothing of the images,
had an great impact of the classification rate,
and  less noisy images provided the best result according to the classification rate.
Greater pixel density led to higher classification rates.
The range of tested k values for the kNN algorithm was too small.
Grid misalignment during data collection occurred, and may have produced false results.
