\chapter{Conclusion}
It could be seen from the data processing that the smoothing of the images, had an great impact of the classification rate, and  less noisy images provided the best result according to the classification rate.   Filter wise could an gaussian filter have shown a better result than the other but due to lack of time, was it not able to test whether the theory was infact true.
