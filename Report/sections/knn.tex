\chapter{kNN}
K - nearest - neighbor or kNN,
is a method for classifying objects based on the distance
to features extracted from ones training data.
The idea in kNN is to identiy k observation which is closest to the new observation trying to be classified.  The class with most vote determines which class the new observation will be classified as.  K is arbitrarily choosen by the user,  and has an effect of the peformance of the algorithm.  k-nn has an optimal classification rate when k becomes very large,  but will computation wise take more time and vice versa.
