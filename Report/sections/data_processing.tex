\section{Data processing}
\subsection{Knn}
The dataprocessing will consist of finding the optimal k and smoothing and DPI which lowers the error rate  This is found by applying knn on different training set, with different smoothing levels, and DPI.  For each case will an contour plot be made, which shows that how each parameter effect each other, and thereby be useful for deciding which parameter gives the optimal peformance.
