\section{Smoothing}
\label{sec:smoothing}
In the previous exercise,
it was found that smoothing the 100 DPI images of the digits
with an 11 by 11 Gaussian kernel with \(\sigma=1.5\)
yielded the highest classification accuracy (90 \%) for G2M2 data.
It was therefore chosen to apply this smoothing as a preprocessing
step to all loaded data.
