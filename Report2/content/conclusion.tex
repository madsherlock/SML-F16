\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
It was chosen to use 100 DPI downsampling on all loaded data,
as the k-NN algorithm used does not scale well with problem size.
Applying k-NN to data from multiple individuals showed that
classifying digits written by individuals not represented
in the k-NN training set is a problem that is significantly
more difficult than if digits from the same individual are
represented in the training data.
In fact, some of the tests showed that the applied k-NN classifier
is classifying fours incorrectly more often than correctly,
yielding it practically useless for digit recognition.
