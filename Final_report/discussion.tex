\section{Discussion}
These results indicate that the entire dataset is sorted and searched through for
each classification, and that this type of problem does not scale well with increasing
dataset size.
Since methods are to be compared with data from several individuals,
it was therefore chosen to use 100 DPI downsampling for further data processing,
at the cost of classification accuracy (as found in the first exercise).
