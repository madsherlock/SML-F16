The k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
algorithms were applied to hand written digit recognition and compared
on overall classification accuracy and prediction time.
The input data consisted of hand written digits which are preprocessed
offline using 4-point perspective transform, cropping and
smoothing, and online using Principal Component Analysis.
The number of neighbours k for the k-NN classifier,
and the cost of constraints violation C of the SVM
classifier with polynomial kernel of degree 2 and scale
factor 0.1 were optimized on a smaller dataset,
and found to be k=5 and C=0.5.

A best overall classification accuracy of 0.854 with a standard
deviation of 0.0205 was obtained with the SVM classifier.

The k-NN classifier had a significantly higher classification accuracy
than the SVM classifier when data from the person whose data was in the test set
was in the training set with data from the remaining persons.
Otherwise, no significant difference in classification accuracy was found
between the two algorithms.

The classification time of the applied k-NN
classifier is more than twice that of the applied SVM classifier.
